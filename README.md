### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex, I'm 24 years old from Chile. My username is the katakana way of pronouncing my name and the day I was born.

ðŸŒ±Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS. So I will be uploading some projects I have worked on so you can watch my growth.

ðŸ”­On the other hand, I'm attending an AWS re/Start program by FundaciÃ³n Forge/CodingDojo Chile. Still got 10 weeks to graduate and take the AWS Cloud Practicioner Exam.
